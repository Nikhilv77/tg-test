        <MotionSubTitle>Terms of use</MotionSubTitle>
        <MotionParagraph>
          Tags is a social networking platform for users to connect,
          communicate, and collaborate with other users through geofencing. This
          platform allows users to explore places, connect people, and discover
          events and businesses in the surrounding locality.
        </MotionParagraph>
        <MotionSubTitle>Objectionable content & behavior</MotionSubTitle>
        <MotionParagraph>
          Objectionable content & behavior: You cannot upload content related to
          pornography, nudity, scam, bullying, abuse, or violence. Legal actions
          will be taken against violators, leading to a permanent ban from using
          Tag Social. Users can report such content for immediate action.
        </MotionParagraph>
        <MotionSubTitle>
          What type of data do we collect through Tags Social
        </MotionSubTitle>

        <MotionParagraph>
          Basic Information: We collect basic information provided during
          account sign-up or business registration for authentication,
          messaging, communication, and connection purposes.
        </MotionParagraph>
        <MotionParagraph>
          Transactions: We collect payment information, including credit or
          debit card details and other billing information, for users making
          purchases or financial transactions through our platform.
        </MotionParagraph>
        <MotionParagraph>
          Photos: Users' uploaded photos are visible publicly and may be used
          for promotional purposes within the platform.
        </MotionParagraph>
        <MotionParagraph>
          Location: We collect users' current location only when media is
          uploaded through our app. This information is not shared with other
          users unless explicitly permitted by the user.
        </MotionParagraph>
        <MotionSubTitle>Can I delete my data?</MotionSubTitle>
        <MotionParagraph>
          You can completely erase your data, including photos, information, and
          others, by sending us a delete account request. We will further verify
          and confirm your request. Completely erasing your data may take 4-5
          working days. Once deleted, you cannot restore your data as we
          permanently erase it from our servers.
        </MotionParagraph>
        <MotionSubTitle>
          Why do we access your Location in the background?
        </MotionSubTitle>
        <MotionParagraph>
          We use access to your current location to show you the media/content
          which were captured on your current location. The core functionality
          of Tags Social depends on GPS and Fine location, so granting location
          access is compulsory. We explicitly do not share your location with
          other users, and we don't collect your current location.
        </MotionParagraph>
        <MotionSubTitle>Report and Abuse?</MotionSubTitle>
        <MotionParagraph>
          Once reported, we take quick action on the post which was reported. We
          check if the report is appropriate, and if it's not, we take legal
          actions against the user who was reported.
        </MotionParagraph>
        <MotionSubTitle>Blocking?</MotionSubTitle>
        <MotionParagraph>
          Once you block a user, the user in the future will not be able to
          visit your profile and will not be able to see your posts.
        </MotionParagraph>
        <MotionSubTitle>Ads and promotions?</MotionSubTitle>
        <MotionParagraph>
          Tags Social shows ads and promotions based on your current location so
          you can avail yourself of offers and coupons from your nearby local
          stores. If any misleading or fraud is found, you can report it, and we
          will take action on it.
        </MotionParagraph>
        <MotionSubTitle>Account Privacy?</MotionSubTitle>
        <MotionParagraph>
          Your account will be visible to all users on Tags Social. However,
          only the users who are friends with you will be able to see your
          posts, and only your friends can send messages to you. You can make
          friends by scanning the QR of other users manually or use Revert
          Likes.
        </MotionParagraph>
        <MotionSubTitle>Post privacy?</MotionSubTitle>
        <MotionParagraph>
          In Tags Social, you are always posting a picture publicly on the
          location it was uploaded. Your uploaded picture will be visible to all
          users who come across the same location. You can increase the
          geographical range of your picture for security purposes; we provide
          checkboxes for privacy and sharing the location of the picture.
        </MotionParagraph>
        <MotionSubTitle>Refund policy</MotionSubTitle>
        <MotionParagraph>
          Tags Social is used to advertise businesses locally. Businesses can
          request a refund for their advertisements under the following
          conditions:
          <ol>
            <li>The advertisement is not visible on the platform.</li>
            <li>The advertisement was published unintentionally.</li>
            <li>The advertisement is posted on the wrong location.</li>
          </ol>
          Refund requests must be made within three days of advertising. Our
          team will assess the request and issue a refund after the assessment.
          Tags Social keeps track of previous refund requests, and frequent and
          unnecessary refund requests may affect future assessments.
